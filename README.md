# AuraForTimer

A tool that I created to change my Asus Z270F RGB lights automatically. This only works for windows currently, due to the dll provided by ASUS

## DOWNLOAD

[DOWNLOAD EXE HERE](https://github.com/whocontributes/AuraForTimer/releases/)

## How to Use

1. Run exe as administrator

2. Modify the config.json, as you see fit. Right now, there are only 4 time zones per day
